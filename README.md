# Market_segmentation-on-MCD
# Market Segmentation - Group Task & McDonald's Case Study - Individual Task

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work done on **Market Segmentation** and the **replication of McDonald's Case Study** in Python. The tasks are divided into two main parts:



## Libraries and Tools Used:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing.
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization.
- `ydata_profiling`: Data profiling and report generation.
- `sklearn`: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing, including:
  - `StandardScaler`: Data standardization.
  - `LabelEncoder`: Label encoding for categorical features.
  - `PCA`: Dimensionality reduction.
  - `RobustScaler`: Scaling with robustness to outliers.

## File Structure
- **Data**: Contains all datasets used in the project.
- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for each task.
- **Results**: Contains analysis, charts, and other results.

## Installation
To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn ydata-profiling scikit-learn
